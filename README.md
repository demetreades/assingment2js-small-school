## 1. Clone repository

`pwd` for current path.

`git clone https://github.com/demetreades/myapp.git`

`ls` for file list.

`cd /myapp` if you are not already into.

<br>

## 2. Install dependencies

If you cloned the repo you need to install dependencies first as listed in the `package.json`. 

Run `npm install`

<br>

## 4. Generate database

_Still under construction_

- First insert your `MySQL` credentials into `/database/init.js` and then run it: `node ./database/init` to make and use schema, create and populate tables. 

  Connection hangs so you need manually to abort via `CTRL+C` after completion unfortunately. _It will be ***fixed in the future***._ 

<br>

- You also need to change credentials at `/services/connection.js`. for the main  connection with the newly created database.

<br>

## 3. Start app

Run `npm start` 

The app listening at PORT: `4000`
